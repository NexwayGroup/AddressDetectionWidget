To enable this widget on your website you have to include javascript documents in your document head section:
 ```html
 <!-- jQuery  -->
 <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
 <!--  Google maps API -->
 <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3.exp"></script>
 <!-- Widget core scripts  -->
 <script src="scripts/jq.addressDetectionWidget.min.js"></script>
 ```

Also there is need to include css styles sheet:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" >
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/addressDetectionWidget.css">
```

*jq.addressDetectionWidget.min.js* and *addressDetectionWidget.css* files you can find in **/dist** folder.

-----------------

Initialization
-----------

First and foremost you have to create widget placeholder
```html
<div id="yourWidgetID" class="adw"></div>
```

The width of the widget is always 100% so it fills its container. Height is fixed.

After that initialize plugin using code below (place it at the bottom of the html document, before </body> tag).
```html

<script>

// WIDGET INITIALIZATION

$('#yourWidgetID').AddressDetectionWidget({
    formId: '#testForm' // id of form you want to fill with collected values
});

</script>

```

Notice that as an option you have to pass 'formId' with the ID name of form which plugin is going to fill.
